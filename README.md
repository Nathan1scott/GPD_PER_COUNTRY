# GPD_PER_COUNTRY

GDP per Country Analysis and Prediction
​This project analyzes global GDP data from 2020 to 2025 and uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to predict future GDP for various countries. 
The analysis is performed in a Jupyter notebook, which includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning model training.
​Key Features
​Data Sourcing: The project uses the GDP per country dataset from Kaggle, available here.
​Data Cleaning: The notebook demonstrates handling of missing values and data type conversions to prepare the dataset for analysis.
​Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
​Visualization of GDP trends over time.
​Specific analysis of key countries like Russia, China, and India.
​Machine Learning:
​An LSTM model is built and trained to forecast future GDP values.
​Training loss visualization confirms model convergence.
​Prediction and Visualization:
​Predicted GDP values for the year after the dataset's end (2026).
​Graphs showing both historical and predicted GDP trends for selected countries.
